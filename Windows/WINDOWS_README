i. Aim
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This script is to allow users to create and
maintain their own graphs for Folding@home stats.
Various reasons occur for someone wanting to keep
stats for themselves - sometimes stats sites go
offline for various reasons or a site may not cater
for the stats the user requires. The aim of this
script files are so that users can download data
themselves and edit it as they see fit.

Unfortunatly, at the time being, data is gethered
from the Extreme Overclokcing site and takes data
from them. Whilst they continue to offer this
service, these stats will work but if they remove
it for any reason, then this scripts will not work.
Until I can program them to store data itself, it
is reliant on EOC offering CSV file downloads of
data and the EOC site being up.

As such, these scripts should *not* be run more
than once ever hour. EOC only updates every 3 hours
so ideally these should only be run about that - 
note that the CSV show the values for the day so
technically running these scripts once a day would
suffice.

ii. Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These scripts require some third party programs to
allow the scripts to work. These are listed below 
with locations. If they disappear, please let me
know and I'll host them (as far as licences allow).

GNU Plot - http://www.gnuplot.info/
Sed - http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/sed.htm
wget - http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm
tail -  from Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit Tools -
http://bit.ly/cA8kem

These programs either need to be added to the
system32 folder in the Windows folder or add the
folder to the Windows path - http://bit.ly/cpaRRF

ftp should be included in all Windows releases.
