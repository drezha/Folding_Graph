This script is to allow users to create and maintain their own graphs for Folding@home stats. Various reasons occur for someone wanting to keep stats for themselves - sometimes stats sites go offline for various reasons or a site may not cater for the stats the user requires. The aim of this script file is that users can download data themselves and edit it as they see fit.

Unfortunatly, at the time being, data is gethered from the Extreme Overclokcing site and takes data from them. Whilst they continue to offer this service, these stats will work but if they remove it for any reason, then this scripts will not work. Until I can program them to store data itself, it is reliant on EOC offering CSV file downloads of data and the EOC site being up.

As such, these scripts should *not* be run more than once ever hour. EOC only updates every 3 hours so ideally these should only be run about that - note that the CSV show the values for the day so technically running these scripts once a day would suffice.
